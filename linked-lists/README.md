# Data Structure Linked List

## Type: Unrestricted Access
We can iterate over the list and remove or insert nodes at any position

## Basic Operations
- POP - Remove the head element and return the data that was removed
- PUSH - Add a node on the begging of the list
- RESET - Reset the list, often used in start
- CLEAR - Remove all the nodes from a linked list
- EMPTY - Check if the list is empty
- INSERT - Add a node at given position
- REMOVE - Remove a node at given position

## Simple Linked List
Each node has its data and a pointer to the next element
The list structure stores the head of the list

## Doubly Linked List
Each node has its data, a pointer to the next element and a pointer to the previous element
The list structure stores the head, the tail and the size of the list
